# Logitech G Shifter USB Adapter for Raspberry Pi Pico 

! WORK IN PROGRESS !

This Project documents the process of programming, wiring and deploying a USB Adapter using a Raspberry Pi Pico written in C

There's a lot of Arduino based adapters on the internet for the Logitech G Shifter, however I had a Raspberry Pi Pico laying around so I decided to mash some code and cables together to come up with a much cheaper solution.

# Wiring

For now the Pico is wired like in the picture below

 //TODO insert image, diagram and make pin layout

Schematics:
